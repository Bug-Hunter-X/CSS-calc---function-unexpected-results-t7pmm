The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if the calculation involves units that are not compatible or if the order of operations is not properly handled. For example, using `calc(100% - 50px)` might not work as expected if the parent element's width is not defined correctly, resulting in incorrect calculations.
