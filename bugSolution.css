To avoid unexpected results when using the `calc()` function, ensure that all units within the calculation are compatible. For example, use pixels (px) or percentages (%) consistently. If you mix units, make sure the order of operations is correct, and prioritize multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. Consider using parentheses to explicitly define the order of operations for complex calculations. If the calculation depends on the dimensions of a parent element, ensure that the parent element's dimensions are properly defined.
